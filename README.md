# Music-Recommendation-System-using-Python
A three way music recomendation system for new users and exisiting users eliminating cold start problem

The Dataset used is Million Song Dataset's subsets - 10000.txt & song_data.csv

# Process

* In this project we present a Personalised Music Recommendation System.<br>
* Even if the user is new, the login data is used to identify a similar user from the database and make recommendations that are relevant to that user.<br>
* Algorithms used: ( Popularity based filtering, Item similarity based Collaborative Filtering, Singular Value Decomposition algorithm )

* User and song interaction matrix based on the number of listens to a song to offer a precise recommendation system.<br>
* Top 5 songs from each method are taken as per ranking to form a hybrid recommendation list thus providing a more accurate recommendation result<br>
* Our Dataset is Million Track Dataset released from Spotify that has been published and licensed to Kaggle for research purpose.<br>
